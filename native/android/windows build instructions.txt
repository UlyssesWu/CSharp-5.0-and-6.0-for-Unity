first, you need to download the android ndk

https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html


copy the contents of the folder that is extracted to 
C:\android-ndk
as this is where the build.bat file is expecting it to be

Then just run build.bat, and the libkernel32.so should be built somewhere inside the libs folder that will be created next to this file
